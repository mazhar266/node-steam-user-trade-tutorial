node-steam-user-trade-tutorial
=========================

** note: this is horribly out of date.  This requires steam-user 1.x and the current version is 3.3.2.  It likely wont run, but still should provide insight into how to use the libraries.

Originally from the article: [Creating a Steam Trade Bot with Node.js/IO.js (Updated for Node-Steam v1.0)](https://firepowered.org/developer/create-a-steam-trade-bot-with-nodejs-iojs-updated-for-node-steam-v1-0/).  This Steam trade bot uses the Steam-Friends nodejs library to quickly deploy a TF2 crate dump bot.
